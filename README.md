libcec-daemon
=============
A simple daemon to connect libcec to uinput. That is, using your TV to control your PC!
by Andrew Brampton

Licence
=======
Currently under the GPL, but only because libcec (on which we depend) is under
the GPL. I have full intentions to relicence this project as BSD when libcec
changes to either LGPL, or I do not need to depend on it anymore.

Build
=====
* Checkout the main source

```
git clone git://github.com/bramp/libcec-daemon.git
```

* Now we need some buildtools and libraries

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf 
sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-system-dev liblog4cplus-dev
```

* Also we need the libcec (version 4.x) libraries. Pulse eight
  provides an easy way to install

```
apt-get install libcec-dev libcec-platform-dev

# or manually build them:
wget http://packages.pulse-eight.net/ubuntu/install-libcec.sh
sudo bash install-libcec.sh
```

* Now build libcec-daemon

```
cd libcec-daemon
./bootstrap && ./configure && make
```

Usage
====
```
Usage: libcec-daemon [options] [usb]

Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]             show help message
  -V [ --version ]          show version (and exit)
  -d [ --daemon ]           daemon mode, run in background
  -l [ --list ]             list available CEC adapters and devices
  -v [ --verbose ]          verbose output (use -vv for more)
  -q [ --quiet ]            quiet output (print almost nothing)
  -a [ --donotactivate ]    do not activate device on startup
  --onstandby <path>        command to run on standby
  --onactivate <path>       command to run on activation
  --ondeactivate <path>     command to run on deactivation
  -p [ --port ] [a[.b.c.d]> HDMI port A or address A.B.C.D (overrides 
                            autodetected value)
  --usb <path>              USB adapter path (as shown by --list)

HDMI port A can be specified as tv.1 or av.1 for HDMI port 1 on respectively the
TV or a connected Audio System. 0 digit is optional for either port or physical
address, so that tv.0 is equivalent to just tv. Similarily, addresses such as
1, 1.0, 1.0.0 and 1.0.0.0 are also equivalent. Specifying 0 by itself is the same
as omitting the port argument, implying that the HDMI port will be autotected.
To summarize, to force libcec-daemon to manage TV HDMI port 1, the following
can be used:
      -p tv.1
      -p 1
      -p 1.0.0.0
The daemon will not work properly if it fails to detect the HDMI port, in which
case the port should be specified manually.

It is possible to run commands to react to a certain TV/AV events such as:
     - power off/standby event (--onstandby)
     - HDMI port switched in (--onactivate)
     - HDMI port switched out (--ondeactivate)
The <path> argument should specify a command or script that is executable by the
default shell for the user running libcec-daemon, usually /bin/sh for root user.
Typically, scripts would suspend/shutdown the host whenever a standby event is
received for power saving, and screensaver and/or media play/pause control could
be hooked to activation or deactivation events. Currently, The command is run
right after the event has occurred, therefore it cannot be invalidated/prevented
by the former returning an exit code other than 0 for example.

A libcec-daemon can be instantiated for each HDMI-CEC adapter available to the
host hardware, and the daemon will automatically use to the first detected one.
If more than one adapter is available, they should be specified by the usb
argument using either its sys-path or dev-path as listed by the --list argument.
